Many executable application codes are much smaller than the web-scale datasets they process, 
and cloud computing avoids large data movement during execution.
The core of a cloud is the server cluster (or VM cluster). 
The cluster nodes are used as compute nodes. 
A few control nodes are used to manage and monitor of the cloud activities. 
The scheduling of user jobs on a cloud is required to assign the work to virtual clusters created for users. 
The gateway nodes provide the access points of the service from the outside world. 
These gateway nodes can be also used for security control of the entire cloud platform.
